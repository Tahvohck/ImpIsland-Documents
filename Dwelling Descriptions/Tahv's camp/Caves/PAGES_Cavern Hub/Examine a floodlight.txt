Examine a floodlight

###
# Description
###
You step over to one of the floodlights. It seems like a standard construction floodlight, but the power cord has been snipped off after two feet and fed into a battery mount. The battery looks like a lightning gun battery, which seems very likely since the mount currently reads "25 days | 86.4%".
