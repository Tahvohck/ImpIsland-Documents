The Hunter's Lodge Selection Box is a heavy rosewood box with a burl inlay, lacquered to a high shine. It contains two BANG Grenades, two WHOOMPH Grenades, two ZAP Grenades, two Crate Sniffers, two Energy Drinks, two Improbability Bombs, two Large Medkits, two cans of Monster Repellent Spray, two pieces of Nicotine Gum, two One-Shot Teleporters, two Ration Packs and two Small Medkits, as well as a Builder's Brew, a Picture Frame, a small box of Cigarettes, a Custom Armour Kit, a Name Colourization Kit, a Cunning Disguise, a Title Change Document, a small bag of Requisition, a small bundle of Quills, a Collar and a Weapon Disguise. The total value of the box's contents adds up to 1,200 Supporter Points, not counting the worth of the eBoy's items, so it's a pretty good deal - and out of 700 points you'll still have a point left over for gift-wrapping.
