`@`bIn more detail:`b
`&One of the rare caninemorphs on the Island. His blue merle fur is matted with grease that won't clean completely out no matter how hard he tries to wash it, which probably explains the ear on fire though not why he seems completely unfazed by it. Snout is short, somewhere between three and four inches long. Ears are on top of his head with full rotation, completely canine there. Although the fur on top of his head is slightly fluffier than it should be, there's nothing that could be properly described as "hair". 

His torso is almost completely human beyond the coat of fur and tail, made all the more obvious by the fact that he almost never wears a shirt in this form. His tail separates from his back just above his hips, and is long enough to almost brush the ground. And no. He doesn't chase it. Most of the time. His legs are digitigrade but it's a fact that's easy to miss because of his jeans. It only really shows up when he's sitting or moving.

`@`bOut-of-character things:`b
`6These are things that are not inherently obvious on a visual inspection. Please, if your character shouldn't be able to detect this, `idon't act on it.`i
`&His mind is being copied near-constantly to the crystal in his bracer.
When the crystal is glowing, information is flowing back into his mind.
He has a strong mental connection to two other minds: Cella and Vesper. They are "shards" of him, and based their personalities off of a corruption of his.
He has a second nervous system, simpler than and running in parallel to his primary one. It also carries a much stronger charge and has spots to store electricity.
