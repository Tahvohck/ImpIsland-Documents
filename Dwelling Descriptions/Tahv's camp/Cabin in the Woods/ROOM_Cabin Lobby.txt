Warm. If you had to describe this room in one word, it'd be "warm".
Not because the air is warm, mind you--although in this climate it does tend to be, even without a fire going--but because of the look of it. Almost everything in here is made either of stained wood, with small exceptions for the fireplace (large, flat stones) and things that need to stand up to abuse, like the firewood rack (thick metal), so the room itself is dark and brown. Windows ring the outer walls and let in as much natural light in as possible, but there are two kerosene lamps hanging from the ceiling for when it gets dark, both of them old-fashioned. 
Stairs to the upper floor take up a large portion of the room, and in fact make up the centerpiece of it. They are wide, deep stairs, that probably have an unfortunate spot where they will creak no matter how carefully you step on them, and the banisters seem to be small trees--two hands would just barely make it around--that have been sanded down just enough to be smooth, but not so much as to remove the knots in the wood.
On the left side of the stairs is a living area, where the fireplace sits surrounded by many hand-made chairs. Benches built along the walls are lined with large flat pillows to make them comfortable, and fuzzy furs thrown over that.
