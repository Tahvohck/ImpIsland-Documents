`@`bIn more detail:`b
`&Seems like he was freshly dropped at first glance, if you discount the gear. And the fact that he's not nude. He's kept a decent bit of his old gamer build from home, honing it a little instead of completely changing it. Some things shine through, though: his skin is fairly pale, at odds with the reddish patches on his cheeks, or the freckles that count for his version of a tan, for example. Hair is messy, dark dirty blond and always just a `ilittle`i bit beyond the point where it should have been washed.

If you you get a closer look, however, you'll notice that his bandolier is customized, the added pockets on his pants, and of course you might remember that Rookies aren't dropped clothed in the first place. Nor do they often carry weapons that can hold their own in a fight: there's a nice-looking one-handed sword strapped to his bandolier and rarely a rifle joins it on a lower sling.

And of course an even closer look will reveal even more: those eyes you thought were just highly constricted? No, the irises go straight to the center, making it almost look like he's blind, but there's no milkiness to them and they follow your movements easily. His skin, at first glance unmarked, is actually littered with small scars of deep scratches, especially on his hands. There's even a handful of larger scars on his arms, presumably where he failed to block properly in a fight. Then, if you happen to catch him with his shirt off, the worst of all of them: a `ilong`i burn along his right shoulder, stretching from a little above his stomach, up and around his shoulder and actually rising up his neck a little, then diving a few inches down his back.

`6These are things that are not inherently obvious on a visual inspection. Please, if your character shouldn't be able to detect this, `idon't act on it.`i
`&His mind is being copied near-constantly to the crystal in his bracer.
When the crystal is glowing, information is flowing back into his mind.
He has a strong mental connection to two other minds: Cella and Vesper. They are "shards" of him, and based their personalities off of a corruption of his.
He has a second nervous system, simpler than and running in parallel to his primary one. It also carries a much stronger charge and has spots to store electricity.
