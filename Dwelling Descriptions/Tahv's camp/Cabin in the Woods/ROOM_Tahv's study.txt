Cabin in the Woods - Study

###
# Description
###
This is a fairly simple study as far as studies go... No wood panelling, no walls filled to the brim with bookshelves, etc. There's `ia`i bookshelf behind the simple (but heavy) wooden desk, a comfy looking chair in front of and behind of it, and obviously the desk itself. There are two doors in the back corner, one to the master bedroom and the other to the master bathroom. All in all it looks like a nice quiet place to work; quiet especially because the walls are soundproofed. Candles provide light for the room, a few on the desk and a few in wall brackets.

There's also the bloody wedding dress hung on one wall, and the twin swords crossed over it. Oh, and the wall of masks on the other.

Don't try dimension-walking into the room either. It won't work.
