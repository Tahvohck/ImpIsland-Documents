At one point...This was meant to be a simple, canvas-style tent.  Its...A bit messy and it's not much bigger than about 6x7 feet all together and near about 7 feet high at the peak...And still somehow two people got all of this stuff in it.  

The floor is a heavy wooden pallet, raised off the ground by a few cinderblocks and mostly covered in all the `istuff`i. The ceiling consists of heavy canvas that's draped over a center pole and stretched out by ropes.  Aside from the additional pieces sewn around the edges to form the walls and doors, someone's painted the whole inside to look like the night sky and there appears to be plastic glow in the dark stars glued to the ceiling along with glass and shiny decorations all over.  

On one side, the place is a complete wreck and it spreads in varying degrees to the rest of it.  Stuff of all sorts is stuffed, stacked and hung all over the palce, including the messy free-standing hammock.  On the side of the tent is a pile of pillows and blankets, like a small nest of brightly colored fabric. Books and journals are stacked along the sides of the tent.
