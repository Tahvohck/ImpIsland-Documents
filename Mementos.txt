Shield pendant[s]

A small wooden shield pendant, with a leather strap to hang it around your neck.

In your hands, or perhaps around your neck, is a shield-shaped pendant carved of wood and no more than two inches long. A leather strap passes through a hole drilled in the top and is tied together in a square knot, leaving enough slack to slip it over your head.

Dragonscale pendant[s]

A dragon scale with a hole drilled through it, hung on a leather cord.

`~In all honesty, there's not much special about this pendant, other than the fact that it's well-crafted. The scale is a little smaller than your palm, with two holes drilled near the top curve. The thin leather strap passes through one from behind and passes back through the other, then gets tied in a simple square knot to complete the loop. `n`nStill... you can't deny that something seems off about it.`nMaybe it's that the strap fits over your head just fine, but is always long enough to sit comfortably on your chest.`nMaybe it's that the scale seems to be changing colors. You can't remember what it was last, but it certainly wasn't `$red.`~ Was it?`nMaybe it's that no matter `iwhat`i color it is, it always shines like an oil sheen, even if it doesn't seem the color could support it.`n`n...Maybe there `iis`i something special about it.
