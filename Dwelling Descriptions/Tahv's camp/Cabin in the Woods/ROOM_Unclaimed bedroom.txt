Cabin in the Woods - Unclaimed Bedroom

###
# Description
###
As bedrooms go, this one is pretty simple. A single heavily blanketed twin bed, a heavy wooden dresser, and a mirror. The floor is wood, and there's enough room to relax in but not enough to hold a party. Light comes from a window during the day and candles--plenty of candles--during the night. Most of the candles are in carryable holders, and matchbooks or boxes aren't hard to find.

This room is currently unclaimed, from the look of it.
