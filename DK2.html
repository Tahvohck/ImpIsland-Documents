&gt; <span class="colDkGreen"> Tahvohck</span><span class="colLtWhite"> pads in, looking around, then over his shoulder for Haven.</span><br>

&gt;<span class="colDkMagenta">H</span><span class="colXLtGreen">a</span><span class="colBlack">v</span><span class="colXLtGreen">e</span><span class="colDkMagenta">n</span><span class="colLtWhite"> trips over a root, sprawling facefirst into a claering. </span><span class="colDkMagenta">"Taaaaahv, wher're you?"</span><br>

&gt;<span class="colDkGreen"> Tahvohck</span><span class="colLtWhite"> walks over and picks her up. </span><span class="colDkGreen">"Right here. You okay?"</span><br>

&gt;<span class="colDkMagenta">H</span><span class="colXLtGreen">a</span><span class="colBlack">v</span><span class="colXLtGreen">e</span><span class="colDkMagenta">n</span><span class="colLtWhite"> grins. </span><span class="colDkMagenta">"Lookie here, Tahv. How many times do I 'ave to tell you, 'mfine! Now, 'syou Horatio's got a grudge against, you try 'n find 'im."</span><br>
&gt; Returning Contestant Earth<span class="colLtWhite"></span><span class="colDkWhite"> quietly heads up into a tree, watching carefully.</span><br>

&gt;<span class="colDkGreen"> Tahvohck</span><span class="colLtWhite"> nods, grinning. </span><span class="colDkGreen">"Ah, so I'm bait?" </span><span class="colLtWhite">It's said highly jokingly. He begins poking around in the jungle, looking for abandoned buildings.</span><br>

&gt; Returning Contestant Earth<span class="colLtWhite"></span><span class="colDkWhite"> blarghs, and falls out the tree, half concious. Tre branches..</span><br>

><span class="colDkMagenta">H</span><span class="colXLtGreen">a</span><span class="colBlack">v</span><span class="colXLtGreen">e</span><span class="colDkMagenta">n</span><span class="colLtWhite"> yawns and stumbles after him. Suddenly, her foot plunges through the ground with the shrieking sound of tearing metal. </span><span class="colDkMagenta">"Owwie... Tahv!"</span><br>

>Returning Contestant Earth<span class="colLtWhite"></span><span class="colDkWhite"> winces as his guitarfalls onto his back.  then his bag lands on his leg, making him grimace a lot.</span><br>

>Returning Contestant Earth<span class="colLtWhite"></span><span class="colDkWhite"> pushes his bag off him quickly, and then gabs his guitar. It morphs into a large axe, and he jumps down into the hole.</span><span class="colDkBlue">"Friggen hell"</span><br>

><span class="colDkGreen"> Tahvohck</span><span class="colLtWhite"> rushes over to her, hand extended in case she falls through farther. </span><span class="colDkGreen">"Well. That looks promising." </span><span class="colLtWhite">He supports her by the shoulder, trying to lift her foot out.</span><br>

>Returning Contestant Earth<span class="colLtWhite"></span><span class="colDkWhite"> has just failed at realizing the situation, and jumps into a tree instead. </span><span class="colDkBlue">"Oops."</span><br>

><span class="colDkGreen"> Tahvohck</span><span class="colLtWhite"> blinks. He didn't misread, did he?</span><br>

>40:50: <span class="colDkMagenta">H</span><span class="colXLtGreen">a</span><span class="colBlack">v</span><span class="colXLtGreen">e</span><span class="colDkMagenta">n</span><span class="colLtWhite"> leans on Tahv and manages to extricate her leg from the hole. She runs her hand down her leg and it comes away bloody. </span><span class="colDkMagenta">"Shiiit! Not good!"</span><br>

><span class="colDkGreen"> Tahvohck</span><span class="colLtWhite"> shakes his head, moving her away from the hole before easing her to the ground and pulling out a medpack. </span><span class="colDkGreen">"No, but it could be worse."</span><br>

>43:35: <span class="colDkGreen"> Tahvohck</span><span class="colLtWhite"> begins cleaning cut, then wraps a gauze and a bandage around it.</span><br>

>44:11: <span class="colDkMagenta">H</span><span class="colXLtGreen">a</span><span class="colBlack">v</span><span class="colXLtGreen">e</span><span class="colDkMagenta">n</span><span class="colLtWhite"> sighs and begins to work on enlarging the hole, tearing away bits of metal with her scythe as she sits down. </span><span class="colDkMagenta">"Mm, shuppose so."</span><br>

>44:19: <span class="colDkGreen"> Tahvohck</span><span class="colLtWhite"> finishes, and looks to her. </span><span class="colDkGreen">"Okay, how's it feel?"</span><br>

>44:25: Returning Contestant Earth<span class="colLtWhite"></span><span class="colDkWhite"> gets up and heads over to the hole. </span><span class="colDkBlue">"I can take away the pain.. and also, should i explore it?"</span><br>

>45:16: <span class="colDkGreen"> Tahvohck</span><span class="colLtWhite"> draws his sword, and helps enlarge the hole, looking down into it. </span><span class="colDkGreen">"Damn. That looks deep."</span><br>

>45:50: <span class="colDkMagenta">H</span><span class="colXLtGreen">a</span><span class="colBlack">v</span><span class="colXLtGreen">e</span><span class="colDkMagenta">n</span><span class="colLtWhite"> moves her leg around, wincing slightly. </span><span class="colDkMagenta">"S'better," </span><span class="colLtWhite">she says, getting to her feet and stumbling over to the hole, peering into it. </span><span class="colDkMagenta">"Bloody dark, innit?"</span><br>

>47:30: Returning Contestant Earth<span class="colLtWhite"></span><span class="colDkWhite"> nods. He heads over to his pack, and grabs an odd, glowing orb from it. </span><span class="colDkBlue">"Either of you want this? Tis a good idea, since my bad luck could cause something to happen to it."</span><br>

>48:20: <span class="colDkMagenta">H</span><span class="colXLtGreen">a</span><span class="colBlack">v</span><span class="colXLtGreen">e</span><span class="colDkMagenta">n</span><span class="colLtWhite"> thinks for a while, and then leaps down the hole. </span><span class="colDkMagenta">"Geronimoooooo!"</span><br>

>48:57: <span class="colDkGreen"> Tahvohck</span><span class="colLtWhite"> nods to Earth, grabbing the orb. </span><span class="colDkGreen">'It is. Let's fix that, hmm?" </span><span class="colLtWhite">The light from the orb dims, and focuses onto the hole, revealing machinery. </span><span class="colDkGreen">"Looks like the right spot."</span><br>

>48:58: Returning Contestant Earth<span class="colLtWhite"></span><span class="colDkWhite"> hops in with the orb. Looks like that decision was made for him.</span><br>

>49:29: Returning Contestant Earth<span class="colLtWhite"></span><span class="colDkWhite"> notes that he's lost the orb. oh well.</span><br>

>49:40: <span class="colDkMagenta">H</span><span class="colXLtGreen">a</span><span class="colBlack">v</span><span class="colXLtGreen">e</span><span class="colDkMagenta">n</span><span class="colLtWhite"> lands with a perfectly executed roll. </span><span class="colDkMagenta">"Earth? When'd you get here?"</span><br>

>49:56: <span class="colDkGreen"> Tahvohck</span><span class="colLtWhite"> blinks. </span><span class="colDkGreen">"Right then." </span><span class="colLtWhite">He jumps down with her, rolling when he hits the ground. </span><span class="colDkGreen">"Leg holding up?"</span><br>

>52:43: Returning Contestant Earth<span class="colLtWhite"></span><span class="colDkWhite"> faceplants on the floor. he gets up slowly, holding his bleeding nose. </span><span class="colDkBlue">"Ow ow ow.. And i went here because I was worried something would happen because you're drunk. Apparently i ran into a god damned FOUNTAIN of bad luck on the way here."</span><br>

>58: <span class="colDkGreen"> Tahvohck</span><span class="colLtWhite"> hmms? as the orb flickers, then goes out. </span><span class="colDkGreen">The hell? </span><span class="colLtWhite">As he looks around, the hole closes up above them, blocking all from view.</span><br>

>28:21: Citizen Boudicca<span class="colLtWhite"> tries to find the hole Earth mentioned but can't find anything. She grumbles and keeps searching.</span><br>

>36:40: Returning Contestant Earth<span class="colLtWhite"></span><span class="colDkWhite"> tosses something out o the whole.. its </span><span class="colXLtGreen">Confetti!</span><span class="colDkWhite"> She runs to Boud mewing towards the rather large hole in the corner of the field.</span><br>

>15:12: <span class="colDkMagenta">H</span><span class="colXLtGreen">a</span><span class="colBlack">v</span><span class="colXLtGreen">e</span><span class="colDkMagenta">n</span><span class="colLtWhite"> blinks in the darkness, somewhat sobered up. </span><span class="colDkMagenta">"Tahv? Earth? What happened? Are we trapped?"</span><br>

>16:08: <span class="colDkGreen"> Tahvohck</span><span class="colLtWhite"> mms as the light returns, rolling up. </span><span class="colDkGreen">"Ugh. I think so."</span><br>

>16:43: Returning Contestant Earth<span class="colLtWhite"></span><span class="colDkWhite"> arghs. </span><span class="colDkBlue">"eave me to be concussed.. ugh.."</span><br>

>16:49: Citizen Boudicca<span class="colLtWhite"> keeps searching, looking under bushes.</span><br>

>17:29: Returning Contestant Earth<span class="colLtWhite"></span><span class="colDkWhite"> hears someone moving up above. </span><span class="colDkBlue">"Oi.. Should i see who that is, dudes?"</span><br>

>18:07: <span class="colDkMagenta">H</span><span class="colXLtGreen">a</span><span class="colBlack">v</span><span class="colXLtGreen">e</span><span class="colDkMagenta">n</span><span class="colLtWhite"> digs around in her bandolier, taking out an already-lit torch. The torch casts flickering shadows about the cement walls, playing over the rusting lab equipment. She shivers. </span><span class="colDkMagenta">"Eerie."</span><br>

>18:24: Citizen Boudicca<span class="colLtWhite"> sighs and sits down to eat a sammich. </span><span class="colLtBlue">"I hope Earth wasn't just pulling my leg. Prankster."</span><br>

>19:24: <span class="colDkGreen"> Tahvohck</span><span class="colLtWhite"> nods to Haven. </span><span class="colDkGreen">"I like it." </span><span class="colLtWhite">To Earth: </span><span class="colDkGreen">"What do you mean?"</span><br>

>19:59: Returning Contestant Earth<span class="colLtWhite"></span><span class="colDkWhite"> sighs. </span><span class="colDkBlue">"I can project my soul up above, to see who is there. D'you want me too?"</span><br>

>21:24: <span class="colDkGreen"> Tahvohck</span><span class="colLtWhite"> nods, closing his eyes. </span><span class="colDkGreen">"Your right, there is someone up there. Give it a shot."</span><br>

>33: <span class="colDkMagenta">H</span><span class="colXLtGreen">a</span><span class="colBlack">v</span><span class="colXLtGreen">e</span><span class="colDkMagenta">n</span><span class="colLtWhite"> walks over to a table of shattered test tubes and Erlenmeyer flasks. Waving her torch over it, she finds a Rubik's cube and pick it up, giving it a spin. </span><span class="colDkMagenta">"It has a certain... charm," </span><span class="colLtWhite">she says, only half sarcastic.</span><br>

>33: Returning Contestant Earth<span class="colLtWhite"></span><span class="colDkWhite"> picks up a green tinted orb, then falls unconscious. A projection of Earth suddenly appears above Boud, with a huge cut on his back, just out of sight. </span><span class="colDkBlue">"Hallo. Glad to see you made it."</span><br>

>24:15: Citizen Boudicca<span class="colLtWhite">'s mouth falls open and some precious sammich falls out. </span><span class="colLtBlue">"Earth, what the -- Hey. So no hole, as you can see." </span><span class="colLtWhite">She opens her arms wide.</span><br>

>24:29: <span class="colDkGreen"> Tahvohck</span><span class="colLtWhite"> watches Earth before moving over to Haven. </span><span class="colDkGreen">"What do you think this place was? First time I've seen an underground bunker here."</span><br>

>25:45: Returning Contestant Earth<span class="colLtWhite"></span><span class="colDkWhite"> looks beneath him. </span><span class="colDkBlue">" I'm still underneath the hole, sooo.. </span><span class="colDkWhite">"He turns around, showing the wound, and then starts rummaging through his pack, wincing a bit.</span><br>

>26:43: Citizen Boudicca<span class="colLtWhite"> winces. </span><span class="colLtBlue">"Is there something wrong with your soul, Earth? It looks a bit... wounded."</span><br>

>26:53: <span class="colDkMagenta">H</span><span class="colXLtGreen">a</span><span class="colBlack">v</span><span class="colXLtGreen">e</span><span class="colDkMagenta">n</span><span class="colLtWhite"> sets the torch in a ring stand, twisting the Rubik's cube with intense concentration. There's the corners... Now the edges... Now- She slides the last row of squares into place. </span><span class="colDkMagenta">"Hey! Tahv! Look, I'm all done!" </span><span class="colLtWhite">Suddenly, a hidden door creaks open.</span><br>

>28:08: <span class="colDkGreen"> Tahvohck</span><span class="colLtWhite"> stares, then snorts. </span><span class="colDkGreen">"Of course there's a secret door." </span><span class="colLtWhite">He holds up the orb. </span><span class="colDkGreen">"Guess we should go in?"</span><br>

>28:21: <span class="colDkMagenta">H</span><span class="colXLtGreen">a</span><span class="colBlack">v</span><span class="colXLtGreen">e</span><span class="colDkMagenta">n</span><span class="colLtWhite"> looks at Tahv. </span><span class="colDkMagenta">"This may answer your question. Mind if a take a look around on my own? I want to see something..." </span><span class="colLtWhite">She extracts another torch from her bandolier, lighting it off the other one and walking into the hole. </span><span class="colDkMagenta">"If I'm not back in 20..."</span><br>

>28:49: Returning Contestant Earth<span class="colLtWhite"></span><span class="colDkWhite"> looks behind him. </span><span class="colDkBlue">"What? I can't see anything... Or at least, I'm not sure." </span><span class="colDkWhite"> he sighs, leaning on one of the trees absently, and his wound starts festering with a dark light.</span><br>

>29:17: <span class="colDkGreen"> Tahvohck</span><span class="colLtWhite"> nods, then carefully sits on the table near the door, eyes half closed.</span><br>

>29:54: Citizen Boudicca<span class="colLtWhite"> scoots forward on her knees. </span><span class="colLtBlue">"It's on your back, Earth. Look, lie down and let me take a look at it. We'll deal with the hole situation later."</span><br>

>30:46: Returning Contestant Earth<span class="colLtWhite"></span><span class="colDkWhite"> eeps, and lets go of the tree. he lies down on his stomach, sighing. </span><span class="colDkBlue">"Oh fine.."</span><br>

>32:16: Citizen Boudicca<span class="colLtWhite"> hmms and looks at the wound first, not touching it. </span><span class="colLtBlue">"There's something wrong Earth. Emotionally I think. Can't have a gash this big and infected looking on your soul without it meaning something."</span><br>

>33:12: Returning Contestant Earth<span class="colLtWhite"></span><span class="colDkWhite"> shrugs. </span><span class="colDkBlue">"I dunno. I feel fine. Just feels like I'm missing somethin, maybe. I dunno."</span><br>

>34:50: Citizen Boudicca<span class="colLtWhite"> leans back on her heels. </span><span class="colLtBlue">"You're missing something from your life? What's that?" </span><span class="colLtWhite">She feels out of place having to heal a wound with words rather than her hands. Her hands are itching to pull that gash closed.</span><br>

>35:38: Returning Contestant Earth<span class="colLtWhite"></span><span class="colDkWhite"> shrugs. </span><span class="colDkBlue">"Well, my power does absorb luck mainly. Maybe that has something to do with it?"</span><br>

>38:11: Citizen Boudicca<span class="colLtWhite"> tilts her head. </span><span class="colLtBlue">"It could. But I dunno how bad luck could hurt your soul itself. I always feel like it's gooey emotions. But who knows. Never had to heal a soul before."</span><br>

>39:16: Returning Contestant Earth<span class="colLtWhite"></span><span class="colDkWhite"> scratches his head. </span><span class="colDkBlue">"Maybe Horatio did something? You know he loves to mess around with crazy stuff. He could have done.. Something.."</span><br>

>42:12: Citizen Boudicca<span class="colLtWhite"> growls slightly, frustrated. She hates not knowing what's wrong, not knowing how to fix this. </span><span class="colLtBlue">"Lemme see if I can fish it out at least." </span><span class="colLtWhite">She carefully extends a few fingers and tries to move the purple mass that appears to be covering the wound.</span><br>

>43:51: Returning Contestant Earth<span class="colLtWhite"></span><span class="colDkWhite"> whimpers a bit. Boud's hand passes through the mass, and touches the wound. the light turns a combination of blue, red, purple,and pink. </span><span class="colDkBlue">" Ow ow ow ow ow.."</span><br>

>44: <span class="colDkGreen"> Tahvohck</span><span class="colLtWhite"> begins to look worriedly at the hole. Almost been 20 minutes...</span><br>

>46:23: Citizen Boudicca<span class="colLtWhite"> bites her lip and keeps going. She tries to scoop out the mass. </span><span class="colLtBlue">"I think it's eating away at you, Earth. If I can just, move it..." </span><span class="colLtWhite">She feels something pull back on her skin and frowns. What was that?</span><br>

>46:30: Returning Contestant Earth<span class="colLtWhite"></span><span class="colDkWhite"> grabs a shovel from his bag, and smashes it into the ground, right on the hole. The shovel remains in his hand, but the hole is a bit more open now.</span><br>

>47:29: <span class="colDkMagenta">H</span><span class="colXLtGreen">a</span><span class="colBlack">v</span><span class="colXLtGreen">e</span><span class="colDkMagenta">n</span><span class="colLtWhite"> sprints back into the main room, panting breathlessly. </span><span class="colDkMagenta">"Ohshitohshitohshitohshitohshit Tahv it's Horatio!" </span><span class="colLtWhite">A low rumbling follows her.</span><br>

>48:20: <span class="colDkMagenta">H</span><span class="colXLtGreen">a</span><span class="colBlack">v</span><span class="colXLtGreen">e</span><span class="colDkMagenta">n</span><span class="colLtWhite"> runs to Tahv and unstraps her scythe from her back. </span><span class="colDkMagenta">"He's angry. Should <i>not</i> have said he'd gained weight."</span><br>

>48:35: Returning Contestant Earth<span class="colLtWhite"></span><span class="colDkWhite"> grits his teeth, and says, </span><span class="colDkBlue">"Ow ow ow ow ow! Gosh darnit! what are you doin back there?"</span><br>

>48:51: <span class="colDkGreen"> Tahvohck</span><span class="colLtWhite"></span><span class="colDkGreen">`s </span><span class="colLtWhite">eyes flick open, and he draws his sword. </span><span class="colDkGreen">"Well, fuck. Doesn't sound happy."</span><br>

>49:23: <span class="colDkGreen"> Tahvohck</span><span class="colLtWhite"> grins at her. </span><span class="colDkGreen">"Couldn't resist a snark, huh?"</span><br>

>49:53: Citizen Boudicca<span class="colLtWhite"> hears a rumbling sound from the new hole and tries to pull back, but finds her hand is now stuck in the light producing mass. </span><span class="colLtBlue">"Ah, what the heck? Come. On. Curse it!" </span><span class="colLtWhite">She tries to jerk her hand out.</span><br>

>50:24: <span class="colDkMagenta">H</span><span class="colXLtGreen">a</span><span class="colBlack">v</span><span class="colXLtGreen">e</span><span class="colDkMagenta">n</span><span class="colLtWhite"> assumes a combat stance as the rumbling grows closer; her scythe in one hand, the other loose for grenades. </span><span class="colDkMagenta">"Alright. Let's do this."</span><br>

>51:26: <span class="colDkGreen"> Tahvohck</span><span class="colLtWhite"> nods, shucking his pack and readying a ZAP. </span><span class="colDkGreen">"Ready when you are."</span><br>

>51:29: Returning Contestant Earth<span class="colLtWhite"></span><span class="colDkWhite">7 screeches. </span><span class="colDkBlue">"Stop Stop Stop! What the hell is going on!?"</span><br>

>53:28: Citizen Boudicca<span class="colLtWhite"> shrieks as she starts to watch the mass snake up her arm, moving outward like vines. </span><span class="colLtBlue">"I think your little friend likes me too much! I can't get loose!"</span><br>

>54: <span class="colDkGreen"> Tahvohck</span><span class="colLtWhite"> looks up. </span><span class="colDkGreen">"Horatio! You may want to get down here!" </span><span class="colLtWhite">The rumbling grows louder.</span><br>

>55:21: <span class="colDkMagenta">H</span><span class="colXLtGreen">a</span><span class="colBlack">v</span><span class="colXLtGreen">e</span><span class="colDkMagenta">n</span><span class="colLtWhite"> blinks as the rumbling grows louder. </span><span class="colDkMagenta">"Tahv... If I come out of th</span><span class="colLtMagenta">is changed... ``rI want you to know that I-</span><span class="colDkMagenta">" </span><span class="colLtWhite">Her voice is drowned out completely as the rumbling makes a transition from loud to ear shattering.</span><br>

>55:31: Returning Contestant Earth<span class="colLtWhite"></span><span class="colDkWhite"> thinks <i>fuck</i>, and tries to rip himself away. He deosn't manage. </span><span class="colDkBlue">"It's draining the entierty of your bad luck! And it's tinged on your feelings so it's feeding back to me! And it hurts! Memories are flying around! Argh!:</span><br>

>56:34: Citizen Boudicca<span class="colLtWhite"> hears Tahv and yells out. </span><span class="colLtBlue">"Little busy up here! Give us a sec!" </span><span class="colLtWhite">The black goo trails up her shoulder and down her back. She shudders at the freezing cold feeling. But it looks like Earth's cut is healing rapidly.</span><br>

>57:44: Returning Contestant Earth<span class="colLtWhite"></span><span class="colDkWhite"> feels the cut fading, but he's still egtting feedback from the glob. He holds his head in pain, whimpering.</span><br>

>57:59: <span class="colDkMagenta">H</span><span class="colXLtGreen">a</span><span class="colBlack">v</span><span class="colXLtGreen">e</span><span class="colDkMagenta">n</span><span class="colLtWhite"> looks up. </span><span class="colDkMagenta">"Don't come down... might be a bad idea.." </span><span class="colLtWhite">she mutters to herself.</span><br>

>58:18: <span class="colDkGreen"> Tahvohck</span><span class="colLtWhite"> looks to Haven, worried. His mouth moves, but the sound plays in her head. </span><span class="colbeige"><i>What? </i></span><span class="colLtWhite"><i></i>He look backs at the hole as a writhing mass of machine burst from the hole, barely in time to dive out of the way.</span><br>

It must be because of today's... events. I'm so sorry." </span><span class="colLtWhite">She watches the mass finally leave Earth and she can move away from him.</span><br>

><span class="colDkGreen"> Tahvohck</span><span class="colLtWhite"> rolls to his feet as the machine slams into the wall, shaking pieces from the ceiling. As the dust settles, a spine chilling laugh rises.</span><br>

><span class="colDkGreen"> Tahvohck</span><span class="colLtWhite"> curses under his breath. He remembers that chuckle. </span><span class="colaquamarine">"Haven, Tahvohck, welcome. So nice to see you both so soon after the last times."</span><br>

>Citizen Boudicca<span class="colLtWhite"> chokes and looks at the mass, now black, on her skin. It looks like a moving mass of vines over her forearm. She can feel it twining over her limbs and shudders. </span><span class="colLtBlue">"S-Sorry Earth. But I think I took whatever was causing your bad luck.  It likes me."</span><br>

>Returning Contestant Earth<span class="colLtWhite"></span><span class="colDkWhite"> sighs. </span><span class="colDkBlue">"It must have been placed by Horatio to stop my wound from healing. I should normalize finally in awhile. I have NO idea what it'll do with you though.</span><br>

>08:07: Citizen Boudicca<span class="colLtWhite"> hears Haven's voice float up from the crack in the ground. She snickers at the thought of Horatio in rapper gear.</span><br>

>08:19: <span class="colDkGreen"> Tahvohck</span><span class="colLtWhite"> looks to Haven as a figure steps through the door. </span><span class="colaquamarine">"Ah, Haven, always the cheerful one, aren't you? And Tahvohck, I see you fixed yourself. Congratulations." </span><span class="colLtWhite">He claps softly.</span><br>

>09: Returning Contestant Earth<span class="colLtWhite"></span><span class="colDkWhite"> grins as well. </span><span class="colDkBlue">"Shall i give him my regards?"</span><br>

That extra-half dimension is such a help, thanks for taking away the other 1.5 extra. Now, I understand you have a... bone to pick with Tahvvie dahhling. Care to explain yourself?"</span><br>

>12:27: Returning Contestant Earth<span class="colLtWhite"></span><span class="colDkWhite"> suddenly holds his head. </span><span class="colDkBlue">"Woah woah woah.. ow... what the eff.."</span><br>

>14:44: <span class="colDkGreen"> Tahvohck</span><span class="colLtWhite"> looks back to the entry as Horatio comes into better view. </span><span class="colDkGreen">"I'd like to know myself," </span><span class="colLtWhite">he says, hissing it out. </span><span class="colaquamarine">"Ah, but telling you would take all the <i>fun</i> from it. But perhaps I'll give you a hint, since you asked. I don't."</span><br>

>16:07: Citizen Boudicca<span class="colLtWhite"> tries to grab Earth by the shoulders to keep him stable, but inch long black claws come out and scratch him. She jumps back and watches the blackness move back into her skin, little curled tendrils on her fingertips.</span><br>

>16:17: <span class="colDkMagenta">H</span><span class="colXLtGreen">a</span><span class="colBlack">v</span><span class="colXLtGreen">e</span><span class="colDkMagenta">n</span><span class="colLtWhite"> juggles her 'nade with one hand. </span><span class="colDkMagenta">"Would this be one of your... <i>charming</i> improbable idiosyncracies?"</span><br>

>16:18: <span class="colDkGreen"> Tahvohck</span><span class="colLtWhite"> grimaces. </span><span class="colDkGreen">"Yeah right."</span><br>

>18:08: Returning Contestant Earth<span class="colLtWhite"></span><span class="colDkWhite"> growls. he sudenly gets a pulse of emotions, totally disorienting him. </span><span class="colDkBlue">"wha.. where?..."</span><br>

>18:19: <span class="colDkGreen"> Tahvohck</span><span class="colLtWhite"> grimaces. </span><span class="colDkGreen">"Yeah right." </span><span class="colLtWhite">Horatio shrugs. </span><span class="colaquamarine">"You may call it that, if you wish. Are you going to <i>do</i> something with that, my dears?" </span><span class="colLtWhite">He motions to the grenades.</span><br>

>19:12: <span class="colDkGreen"> Tahvohck</span><span class="colLtWhite"> grins. </span><span class="colDkGreen">"Sure. Haven, eyes!" </span><span class="colLtWhite">He throws the ZAP.</span><br>

>20:16: Citizen Boudicca<span class="colLtWhite"> reaches out carefully to try to not scratch him. The claws inch out as they get closer to Earth. She pokes him carefully again.</span><br>

>21:00: Returning Contestant Earth<span class="colLtWhite"></span><span class="colDkWhite"> gahs.</span><span class="colDkBlue">"Oi! I think that  little bugger did something to me.. I'm getting weird vibes.."</span><br>

Smiling madly, she says one word. </span><span class="colDkMagenta">"Fetch." </span><span class="colLtWhite">Suddenly, two immense grey rabbits in bondage gear burst from Haven's bandolier. </span><span class="colDkMagenta">"Blair-bear, meet the Bondage Bunnies."</span><br>

>24:54: <span class="colDkMagenta">H</span><span class="colXLtGreen">a</span><span class="colBlack">v</span><span class="colXLtGreen">e</span><span class="colDkMagenta">n</span><span class="colLtWhite"> charges  at Horatio, the Bondage Bunnies close behind her. Swinging her scythe, she manages to graze him slightly.</span><br>

>24:57: Citizen Boudicca<span class="colLtWhite"> shakes her head, she feels like a wave of emotions overpowers her own. Mostly just a tsunami of confusion. </span><span class="colLtBlue">"What the heck? M-Me too."</span><br>

>25:28: <span class="colDkGreen"> Tahvohck</span><span class="colLtWhite"> covers his eyes as the ZAP goes off. Another laugh. </span><span class="colaquamarine">"If you insist!" </span><span class="colLtWhite">There is a distinct lack of grenade explosions, and when the light fades, Horatio is nowhere to be seen.</span><br>

>26:31: <span class="colDkGreen"> Tahvohck</span><span class="colLtWhite"> looks around, then to Haven. </span><span class="colDkGreen">"Where is he? Did you get him?"</span><br>

>26:39: Returning Contestant Earth<span class="colLtWhite"></span><span class="colDkWhite"> shakes his head, and sees a faint green string floating in front of him. </span><span class="colDkBlue">"Am i drunk. Seriously I'm seeing glowing, green string in front of me... Augh!"</span><br>

>27:47: <span class="colDkMagenta">H</span><span class="colXLtGreen">a</span><span class="colBlack">v</span><span class="colXLtGreen">e</span><span class="colDkMagenta">n</span><span class="colLtWhite"> recoils, slightly blinded. </span><span class="colDkMagenta">"Wha- where'd he go? He was right here, and I'm pretty sure I got him..." </span><span class="colLtWhite">The Bondage Bunnies stand still, and wordlessly take out some cat o' nine tails.</span><br>

>32:40: Citizen Boudicca<span class="colLtWhite"> moves slightly and sees the line flash in the sunlight. She reaches a hand up and plucks it like a guitar string. For a moment, she feels emotions that are not her own, but only vaguely this time.</span><br>

>33:15: Returning Contestant Earth<span class="colLtWhite"></span><span class="colDkWhite"> meeps. </span><span class="colDkBlue">"Boud, are you okay?"</span><br>

>33:43: <span class="colDkGreen"> Tahvohck</span><span class="colLtWhite"> bites his lip as he pads over to Haven. </span><span class="colDkGreen">"I don't know..." </span><span class="colLtWhite">A tsk, off to the side. </span><span class="colaquamarine">"Impressive. You hit me." </span><span class="colLtWhite">Horatio touches the quickly-healing cut, then looks up, Haven's grenade in hand. </span><span class="colaquamarine">"Catch." </span><span class="colLtWhite">And the grenade is thrown back.</span><br>

>34:03: Returning Contestant Earth: <span class="colLtCyan">Grem</span><br>

>34: <span class="colDkMagenta">H</span><span class="colXLtGreen">a</span><span class="colBlack">v</span><span class="colXLtGreen">e</span><span class="colDkMagenta">n</span><span class="colLtWhite"> walks back over to Tahv. </span><span class="colDkMagenta">"This is creeping me out... and forget what I was saying. 'Snothing."</span><br>

>35:17: <span class="colDkGreen"> Tahvohck</span><span class="colLtWhite"> pushes Haven out of the way of the grenade. </span><span class="colDkGreen">"Crap, look out!"</span><br>

>35:23: Returning Contestant Earth<span class="colLtWhite"></span><span class="colDkWhite"> feels a tugging of emotions as well. the line fades, after connecting with the black glob thing. </span><span class="colDkBlue">"... Okayyy.. I think we're okay. ... Its.. crazy.."</span><br>

>35:47: <span class="colDkMagenta">H</span><span class="colXLtGreen">a</span><span class="colBlack">v</span><span class="colXLtGreen">e</span><span class="colDkMagenta">n</span><span class="colLtWhite"> turns quickly and whacks the grenade into the passage she explored earlier as the Bondage Bunnies rush to Horatio, flaling cat'o nine  tals menacingly. </span><span class="colDkMagenta">"Home run!" </span><span class="colLtWhite">Haven cries as she tracks the 'nade's progress.</span><br>

>36:32: Citizen Boudicca<span class="colLtWhite"> nods slightly. </span><span class="colLtBlue">"I think we're connected by this <i> thing</i>. But other than that I feel fine I think. A little freaked out, but okay. Can we head to the 'Dello? I want to find out how far this thing goes."</span><br>

>38:21: Returning Contestant Earth<span class="colLtWhite"></span><span class="colDkWhite"> shrugs. </span><span class="colDkBlue">"Sure. See you there."</span><br>

>38:43: <span class="colDkMagenta">H</span><span class="colXLtGreen">a</span><span class="colBlack">v</span><span class="colXLtGreen">e</span><span class="colDkMagenta">n</span><span class="colLtWhite"> joins the fray as the 'nade explodes with a BOOM. </span><span class="colDkMagenta">"Oh, come on, Hor-dizzle! What's the fun in actually trying to kill us?" </span><span class="colLtWhite">she says with a grin.</span><br>

>39:18: <span class="colDkGreen"> Tahvohck</span><span class="colLtWhite"> ducks to the side as Haven swings. </span><span class="colDkGreen">"Careful!" </span><span class="colLtWhite">When he lands, he rushes to Horatio, only to find him gone, then beside Haven. </span><span class="colaquamarine">"Now then, what shall we take from you, hmm? What do you value?"</span><br>

>39:32: Returning Contestant Earth<span class="colLtWhite"></span><span class="colDkWhite"> disconnects his souled link, and returns to his body. he wakes up, seeing the two fighters after Horatio. 1"Youtwo need help, or D'you got it covered?"</span><br>

>41:43: <span class="colDkGreen"> Tahvohck</span><span class="colLtWhite"> blinks as Horatio chuckles, on the edge of the room again. </span><span class="colaquamarine">"Kill you? Whatever gave you that impression, dear?"</span><br>

>43:36: Returning Contestant Earth<span class="colLtWhite"></span><span class="colDkWhite"> shrugs. He guesses they do?... Ugh. He needs to go. he's useless, as weak as he is.. Earth quickly hops out of the hole, gets his things, and sets off for the bordello, feeling like shit.</span><br>

>44: <span class="colDkMagenta">H</span><span class="colXLtGreen">a</span><span class="colBlack">v</span><span class="colXLtGreen">e</span><span class="colDkMagenta">n</span><span class="colLtWhite"> takes a swing at Horatio. </span><span class="colDkMagenta">"Oh, you know, the simple lack of tea and all- oh, sorry, sources now say it was the <i>live grenade</i>." </span><span class="colLtWhite">Haven manages to wrap an arm around his neck. </span><span class="colDkMagenta">"And for fuck's sake, no way in hell am I telling you what I value."</span><br>

>47:37: <span class="colDkGreen"> Tahvohck</span><span class="colLtWhite">  moves closer as Horatio wisps away, then pushes her lightly from behind. </span><span class="colaquamarine">"Oh, but I <i>know</i> you two. A measly grenade is no match for you. And no need to tell me, I know. Your charming personality, your wit, those should do." </span><span class="colLtWhite">He turns to Tahvohck.</span><br>

>49:41: <span class="colDkGreen"> Tahvohck</span><span class="colLtWhite"> swings at Horatio. </span><span class="colDkGreen">"And what do you want from me, huh?" </span><span class="colaquamarine">"A good question. What should I do to you, hmm?"</span><br>

>50:13: <span class="colDkMagenta">H</span><span class="colXLtGreen">a</span><span class="colBlack">v</span><span class="colXLtGreen">e</span><span class="colDkMagenta">n</span><span class="colLtWhite"> stiffens, then snarls. </span><span class="colDkMagenta">"Don't you fucking touch him! You've hurt him enough already!"</span><br>

>52:37: <span class="colDkGreen"> Tahvohck</span><span class="colLtWhite"> swings off balance as Horatio dodges, turning back to her. </span><span class="colaquamarine">"Oh really? And why do <i>you</i> care so much? After all, all I do is pranks, really. I rarely actuall <i>hurt</i> anyone."</span><br>

>55:03: <span class="colDkMagenta">H</span><span class="colXLtGreen">a</span><span class="colBlack">v</span><span class="colXLtGreen">e</span><span class="colDkMagenta">n</span><span class="colLtWhite"> slices through the air. </span><span class="colDkMagenta">"That's none of your business! And yeah, you hurt people! How do you think Tahv felt when he couldn't talk to anyone? How do you think I felt when you blew me up and didn't put me back together?"</span><br>

>55:56: <span class="colDkMagenta">H</span><span class="colXLtGreen">a</span><span class="colBlack">v</span><span class="colXLtGreen">e</span><span class="colDkMagenta">n</span><span class="colLtWhite"> manages to catch Horatio upside the head with the handle of her scythe. </span><span class="colDkMagenta">"Pretty hurt."</span><br>

>58:55: <span class="colDkGreen"> Tahvohck</span><span class="colLtWhite"> finds himself locked in place as Horatio's head splits, then reforms. Waving a hand, Haven is locked down too. </span><span class="colaquamarine">"Ah, but you got better, didn't you? And so did our Tahvohck. And I'm <i>making</i> it my business. Now then. <i>Why</i>. Friendship? Deeper?"</span><br>

>01: <span class="colDkMagenta">H</span><span class="colXLtGreen">a</span><span class="colBlack">v</span><span class="colXLtGreen">e</span><span class="colDkMagenta">n</span><span class="colLtWhite"> shakes with anger. </span><span class="colDkMagenta">"I owe you alot. You've brought me friends, you let me stay in one place and time, and you've given me many things. But you have no right to that."</span><br>

>07:16: <span class="colDkGreen"> Tahvohck</span><span class="colLtWhite"> looks questioningly at Haven as Horatio sighs. </span><span class="colaquamarine">"Perhaps not, Haven. But I hope you understand that the things I do to you, I do for your benefit." </span><span class="colLtWhite">He leans back. </span><span class="colaquamarine">"Perhaps I shall let you free with nothing changed. It's been a while."</span><br>

>08:15: <span class="colDkMagenta">H</span><span class="colXLtGreen">a</span><span class="colBlack">v</span><span class="colXLtGreen">e</span><span class="colDkMagenta">n</span><span class="colLtWhite"> blinks, looking at Tahv. </span><span class="colLtMagenta"><i>5 req says he's lying.</i></span><br>

>13:20: <span class="colDkGreen"> Tahvohck</span><span class="colLtWhite"> looks back to Haven. </span><span class="colbeige"><i>Maybe. Something feels off. </i></span><span class="colLtWhite">Horatio grins. </span><span class="colaquamarine">"Oh, you think I'm lying, then?" </span><span class="colLtWhite"> He looks her in the eyes, lays a finger on her forhead. </span><span class="colaquamarine">"Have it your way." </span><span class="colLtWhite">A glow spreads from his finger, covering her.</span><br>

>14:44: <span class="colDkMagenta">H</span><span class="colXLtGreen">a</span><span class="colBlack">v</span><span class="colXLtGreen">e</span><span class="colDkMagenta">n</span><span class="colLtWhite"> sneers as the glow envelops her, and in a stereotypical captive-captor moment, she manages to spit int his face before the glow engulfs her completely.</span><br>

>18:23: <span class="colDkGreen"> Tahvohck</span><span class="colLtWhite"> stares at Horatio as the glow fades. </span><span class="colDkGreen">"What did you do to her!?" </span><span class="colLtWhite">Horatio rubs the spit off his face as he turns to face him. </span><span class="colaquamarine">"Exactly what I daid I would. And it's your job to help her." </span><span class="colLtWhite">The two are released as he fades away, smiling. </span><span class="colaquamarine">Good luck</span><br>

>20:08: <span class="colDkGreen"> Tahvohck</span><span class="colLtWhite"> rushes over to Haven dropping his sword. </span><span class="colDkGreen">"Are you okay?"</span><br>

>21: <span class="colDkMagenta">H</span><span class="colXLtGreen">a</span><span class="colBlack">v</span><span class="colXLtGreen">e</span><span class="colDkMagenta">n</span><span class="colLtWhite">'s eyes roll to the back of her head, and she sprawls on the ground, muttering. </span><span class="colLtMagenta">"So sorry... too scared to tell you... I don't want to go..." </span><span class="colLtWhite">She shudders once, fully unconscious.</span><br>

>23:47: <span class="colDkGreen"> Tahvohck</span><span class="colLtWhite"> shakes her. </span><span class="colDkGreen">"Haven? Haven! Ah, hell. I'm <i>not</i> leaving you here." </span><span class="colLtWhite">He hoists her onto his shoulder, then looks around for a way out.</span><br>

>27:34: <span class="colDkGreen"> Tahvohck</span><span class="colLtWhite"> spots a stairway leading up and floows it, emerging into the jungle.</span><br>

>27:54: <span class="colDkGreen"> Tahvohck</span><span class="colLtWhite"> spots a stairway leading up and folows it, emerging into the jungle.</span><br>

>31:52: <span class="colDkGreen"> Tahvohck</span><span class="colLtWhite"> looks to Haven, then gently lays her down and shrugs on his backpack before picking her back up. </span><span class="colDkGreen">It'll be okay, Haven. </span><span class="colLtWhite">He carries her towards Kittania.</span><br>

>08:35:20: <span class="colDkGreen"> Tahvohck</span><span class="colLtWhite"> jogs in, slowing to a halt near the hole in the ground. Kneeling and looking into it, he spots what he's looking for. </span><span class="colDkGreen">Good.</span><span class="colLtWhite"> He jumps down the hole, climbing up the stairs, sword in hand, shortly thereafter, and jogs back out.</span><br>
