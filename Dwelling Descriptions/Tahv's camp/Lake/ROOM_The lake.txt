The lake

# Description

The trees widen out into a large clearing here, a lake shining in it's center. The path splits, one tail leading down to a dock where you sit and enjoy the water, another winding to a bonfire pit on one of the peninsulas into the lake, and the last winding back into the woods, though a tree has fallen across it right now. Walking along the path, you can't help but be grateful for it's presence: the grass around the lake--where it hasn't been beaten down--is waist high and blows around with the slightest of breezes.


[Dead]
You can't help but feel sad as you enter the clearing here, dead grass sitting limp around your feet. What was a beautiul lake has long dried up, leaving nothing but cracked dirt behind in it's wake, a small mound in it's center showing ruins of- You blink as the mirage fades away, revealing this place's true nature.

[Dock]
The dock creaks lightly as you step out onto it, as wooden docks are wont to do. Care for a swim?

[Bonfire]
Now this is a firepit. Six feet across, there always seems to be a teepee of logs taller than you inside, begging for a good night with good company, and plenty of stories. As with any good pit, logs surround it for those who want to sit.
