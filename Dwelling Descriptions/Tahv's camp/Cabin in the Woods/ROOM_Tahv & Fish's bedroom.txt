Cabin in the Woods - Master Bedroom


###
# Description
###
The master bedroom is as warm as the lobby--albeit slightly brighter--with wood stained closer to a cherry than a mahogany. A king-sized bed is the main feature of the room, right below the large window on the wall so that the sun falls on it during the afternoon, perfect for taking a catnap in the sun. Two curtains hang from the window, one thin to mute the light and a heavy blackout one to block all of it. A tall dresser and a short one are on the opposite wall, the tall one mostly utilitarian and the short one displaying a set of sentimental knick-knacks. The floor is wood with a large coarse-fiber rug between the bed and dressers.
