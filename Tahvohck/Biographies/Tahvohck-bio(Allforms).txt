You enter the Bio, expecting some explanation as to what's going on with Tahvohck right now, but well... There's nothing here. Or, more accurately...

Well. `iTahvohck's`i here. Or... Someone who looks very much like his human form, with slight differences. He turns to face you.

`2Oh! "Ah... I suppose you're wondering what's going on, aren't you? Uh..."
`&He rubs his head.
`2"I can't really tell you right now. I wish I could, but...well, my hands are a bit tied right now."
`&He looks away for a second, thinking.
`2"I can tell you this much, I guess. He's..ahh, how to to put it? Every form he's had at once, and yet only one at a time. He's switching between each one but...it seems like he's been in each form the whole time."
`&A pause before he starts talking again.
`2"That's not really helpful, is it? Ugh. ... Look, um... You need to leave now. There's a lot I need to do in here, and I've probably talked to much already." `&A quick little smile. `2"Sorry I wasn't very helpful." `&He ushers you out. `2"Come back later, maybe."
