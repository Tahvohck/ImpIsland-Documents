# Description
###
You're standing in a simple, canvas-style tent. The floor is a heavy wooden pallet, raised off the ground by a few cinderblocks.The ceiling consists of heavy, olive-drab canvas, draped over a center pole and stretched out by ropes, and with additional pieces sewn around the edges to form the walls and doors. In all, the tent is about six feet wide by seven feet deep, and seven feet tall down the center.`n
`nOn either side of the tent sits a sturdy cot, the one on the right has a felt sleeping bag on it and some spare gear under, while the one on the left is empty. Surely Tahvohck wouldn't mind you using the spare?
