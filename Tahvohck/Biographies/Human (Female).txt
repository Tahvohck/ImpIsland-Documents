`@`bIn more detail:`b
`&Seems like she was freshly dropped at first glance, if you discount the gear. And the fact that she's not nude. She's kept a decent bit of her old gamer build from home, honing it a little instead of completely changing it. Some things shine through, though: her skin is fairly pale, at odds with the reddish patches on her cheeks, or the freckles that count for her version of a tan, for example. Hair is messy, dirty blond and always just a `ilittle`i bit beyond the point where it should have been washed. She's a bit slimmer than her normal male build, though certain things (wider hips, modest chest) offset most of the weight loss she'd get from that.

If you you get a closer look however you'll notice that her bandolier is customized, the added pockets on her pants, and of course you might remember that Rookies aren't dropped clothed in the first place. Nor do they often carry weapons that can hold their own in a fight: there's a nice-looking one-handed sword and a much larger rifle strapped to her bandolier.

And of course an even closer look will reveal even more: those eyes you thought were just highly constricted? No, the irises go straight to the center, making it almost look like she's blind, but there's no milkiness to them and they follow your movements easily. Her skin, at first glance unmarked, is actually littered with small scars of deep scratches, especially on her hands. There's even a handful of larger scars on her arms, presumably where she failed to block properly in a fight. Then, if you happen to catch her with her shirt off, the worst of all of them: a `ilong`i burn along her right shoulder, stretching from a little above her stomach, up and around her shoulder and actually rising up her neck a little, then diving a few inches down her back.
