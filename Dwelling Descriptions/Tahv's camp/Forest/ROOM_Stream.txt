The Stream

# Description
###
As you walk along the trail a burbling stream comes into view; standing at its edge you'd guess it's somewhere between 5' and 10' across. Peering into the clear water, it's... oh, maybe 4 feet deep? Hard to tell without climbing in. You could, too; the bottom seems to be nothing but sand and small, smooth stones. A bridge stretches across at one of the narrower sections, trail continuing on the other side. `n`nLooking back into the water, the glint of scales flashes in the near the shore. Hmm... Looks like the fishing would be good, if you had a rod or a net. `nAny who chose to bathe in it will also find that the cold water suds on its own, as long as the intent to clean is there.
