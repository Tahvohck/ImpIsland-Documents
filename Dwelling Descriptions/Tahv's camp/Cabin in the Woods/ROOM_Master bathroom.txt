Cabin in the Woods - Master Bathroom

###
# Description
###
The bathroom's most visible aspect is the large tub that takes up a whole corner, suitable for at least two to three people to lounge in comfortably at once. Small polished-iron inlets in the walls keep the candles within them safely separated from the wood of their respective walls whilst reflecting their light out into the room. Once you're done with your bath, a hip-tall modified bookcase has cubbies stuffed full of towels in easy grabbing range of the bathtub, and on its other side is a brushed-steel sink, cold only.
