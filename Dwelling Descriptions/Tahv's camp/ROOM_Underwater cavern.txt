The sound echoes off the walls, the persistent drip of water.`n`n

The cavern is lit by `gImprobably green`~ glowsticks mounted in the rocks, tinting the room green... though oddly, the dominant light feels like sunlight filtering from somewhere just around the corner...`n`n

This underwater cave seems like it's part of a movie set: the pool in the center refuses to flood, even if pressure states it should, and the edges are sheer drops, execept for that one spot that almost seems like stairs out of the water. Towards the "stairs," the rock warps and juts out, forming a ledge: sitting on it, you could swear it's contoured to the human body, with a space for a tail. The edges of the pool, though sheer, are smooth as well; either Improbability or simple water and time has smoothed them.`n`n

The pool itself is about about 15 feet across, and slightly oval: large, but not so much that it would be tiring to swim across. The walkway around it is wide enough to fit three people at its thinnest, and wide enough for a small crowd at its thickest, by the stairs. Looking up, the walls have many small niches in them: some only large enough to hold one of the many glowsticks, others large enough that you could easily store things in. And, indeed, some are in use: the most promient has a stack of towels in it, another seems to have a few changes of clothes.`n`n
