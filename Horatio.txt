Oh, don't come looking in here, trying to find out who I am, what I look like. YOU know already, don't you? I am the one who haunted you when you came here, looming ever closer with each passing day, and then, finally, it was over. Except it wasn't, hmm? I'm still out there, mocking you with my very existence. I've allowed some of you to make your peace with me, however fragile it is, others I torment, just because I can.

Now go on, run along little ones, play your games at my feet. I'll be watching, keeping you safe and letting you live in my home.


...After all, you are my children, aren't you?
