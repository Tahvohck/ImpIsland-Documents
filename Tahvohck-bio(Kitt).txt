`@Observable details:
`6Kittymorph
`&Standing at 5'10", he's physically pretty close to the "average" Kittymorph if there ever was one. Mid-length brownish fur, slightly mangled on his left shoulder and lightly grease-stained all over, pointed ears (Uh... right one is on fire), tail (fluffy). His eyes lack the characteristic "slit" pupils, favoring instead, well, none. Instead there's only a blue, liquid-like iris straight to the center. 

Unlike many other Kittymorphs, he seems to have retained a decent portion of his human modesty, to the point where while he has little problem stripping down to bathe or swim, he prefers to wear a pair of worn jeans normally. Though if you were to ask him about it he'd probably cite a more useful reason, that they protect his legs nicely while in the jungle. This mind for usefulness likely also explains the pockets sewn on cargo-style, his hiking boots, and the cloak he often wears. Beyond that, there's nothing much out of the ordinary: just a small shield pendant around his neck and a plate with a large purple crystal set in it strapped to his wrist.

Then of course, there's his gear: while at first glance his bandolier seems standard-issue, from the back you can see he's modified it to mount a sheath and rifle, though only the sword is present with any regularity.
