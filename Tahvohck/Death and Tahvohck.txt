Death and Tahvohck:

Fights her for "respawn" rights.
Requires the Memento Mori knife to be with his body to use.
Memento Mori has a notch for every life.
When he's out, he has to be brought back back manually... but still needs the knife. If he doesn't have it, his soul won't stick to his body.
"Combat rooms", rooms where death has no consequence, he is expressly forbidden from using. If he dies in there, all saved lives are null and he still has to be brought back.
He can transfer a life to another if he chooses. Requires Memento Mori.
