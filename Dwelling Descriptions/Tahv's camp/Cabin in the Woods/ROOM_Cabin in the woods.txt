The path opens into another clearing--about a third the size of the lake--and continues around the edge of it, stopping at a log cabin.

The cabin is simple, if somewhat large: with two floors and a raised porch, it'd make a respectable house. The porch has several chairs spread around a table on one side and a hanging swing on the other, big enough for two people to sit in.
Tucked into the woods is an outhouse--yes, that's a thing that has to be dealt with, get over it--that's thankfully only rarely used. You may not want to get too close to it unless you need to use it, regardless.
