                        <h2>The Book</h2>
                        <p>Archer briskly walks through the gates of Improbable Central, nodding a hello to a few passers by. Legs making their way towards the abandoned church, her face shifts between different expressions while she has another internal argument.</p>
                        
						<p><span class="colbeige"><i>Where are we going?</i></span></p>
						
                        <p><span class="colLtCyan"><i>Nowhere. Don't worry about it.</i></span></p>
						
						<p><span class="colbeige"><i>Oh come on. I know something's up. Why don't you just tell me?</i></span></p>
						
						<p>She stops at the decrepit doors, placing a paw to push one of them open carefully. A determined look wipes across her face as she replies to the voice, <span class="colLtCyan"><i>Do you really want to know? Fine. I'm putting you and your little book back where they belong. On that dusty old shelf.</i></span></p>
						
						<p><span class="colbeige"><i>What?! No! Don't do that! Why would you?</i></span></p>
						
						<p><span class="colLtCyan"><i>Honestly, I'm tired of you. I'm tired of never having a peaceful thought to myself.</i></span></p>
						
						<p><span class="colbeige"><i>B-but-</i></span></p>
						
						<p><span class="colLtCyan"><i>I know you said you'd ask to "come in," but I know you'll just linger in there, don't try and act like I don't know. </i></span>Archer pads back over to the countless bookshelves stowed off in the corner, containing volume upon volume of texts. Looking through the shelves, she finds the one with the freshest amount of dust and crouches down.
						
						<p><span class="colbeige"><i>P-please, don't leave me here again!</i></span>
						
						<p><span class="colLtCyan"><i>Why not?! You haven't even given me your name, and you've been invading my mind for at least a week now!</i></span>
						
						<p><span class="colbeige"><i>...It's... my name is Chandra....</i></span></p>
						
						<p><span class="colLtCyan"><i>A little late now, don't you think?</i></span></p>
						
						<p><span class="colbeige"><i>You, you never asked...</i></span></p>
						
						<p>She pauses, her pack half open. Archer bites her lip, knowing Chandra's right. Only dwindling on the thought for a moment, she shakes her head and continues to pull the book out.</p>
						
						<p><span class="colbeige"><i>I know you don't want to just throw me away. You liked having me around for magic. I know it!</i></span></p>
						
						<p><span class="colLtCyan"><i>Even if I did, the others are right. It's for the best.</i></span></p>
						
						<p>The voice becomes frantic, trying to throw up a defense for keeping herself there. <span class="colbeige"><i>Best for who? You? What about me?! Don't I count for anything?</i></span> Archer pauses again, biting her lip.</p>
						
						<p><span class="colLtCyan"><i>Y-yes. But, you gave that up when you started invading my thoughts! I'm sorry but I'm not changing my mind!</i></span> She places the large, worn, leather book on the shelf, ignoring the pleas of the girl. The book seems to glow a bright <span class="colbeige">white</span> for a short while. Worried, Archer takes a few steps back, but lets out a sigh of relief as the book ceases to glow.</p> 
						
						<p><span class="colLtCyan"><i>Well, that was easier than I-</i></span></p>
						
						<p><span class="colbeige"><i>Please go back. I can help you understand the book.</i></span> Puzzled, Archer looks down at the bracelet Thalis had given her, now glowing a bright <span class="colbeige">white</span> instead of the book.</p> 
						
						<p><span class="colLtCyan"><i>Really? Why can't you just accept the fact that I'm not going to use that book?</i></span> She starts pulling at the bracelet, determined to remove it.</p>
						
						<p><span class="colbeige"><i>Wait, no! Don't do that! You'll regret it, I promise.</i></span></p>
						
						<p>Archer scoffs at what she thinks is an idle threat, retorting out loud, <span class="colLtCyan">"Oh yeah? What's the worst you could d-"</span> She never has the chance to finish the sentence. Just as she pulls the bracelet free, white tendrils of energy grab onto her wrist sinking in. With a yelp her eyes roll back and she crumples to the floor, unconscious.</p>
						
						<p>A short time later, she twitches and sluggishly pulls herself to her feet, head still lowered at the ground. She <span class="colDkOrange">blinks</span>, then <span class="colDkOrange">bli</span><span class="colaquamarine">nks</span> again. With a sudden shudder, she collapses to her knees. Paws pat herself down as if she didn't know what she felt like. A short time later, the hands are brought to eye level with a curious expression. Archer stands again, a bit awkwardly, and looks back at her tail, flicking it back and forth. With a worried tone, she remarks, <span class="colbeige">"Uh oh..."</span> With another twitch, she shakes her head.</p>
						
						<p><span class="colLtCyan">"Ugh... my h-head... What happened?"</span> A small flinch washes across her body as she replies to herself, <span class="colbeige">"I... I told you not to yank the bracelet off."</span> This time, the switch is barely even noticed, only by a <span class="colDkOrange">bli</span><span class="colaquamarine">nk</span>.</p>
						
						<p><span class="colLtCyan">"Wait, what's going on? How are you doing that? What did you do?!"</span> She blinks again, and starts biting her lip.</p>
						
						<p><span class="colbeige">"Err… well. You know how I could just kind of float around in your mind, but I was in the book?"</span> Archer blinks another time, and closes her eyes as if she was expecting a punch to the gut.</p>
						
						<p><span class="colLtCyan">"Y-yeah… what happened?"</span></p>
						
						<p><span class="colbeige">"Well, I think I went from being inside of the bracelet, to inside you when you tore it off…"</span> She pauses, adding, <span class="colbeige">"I told you that you'd probably regret it."</span> There's not even a blink this time, just a fluent transition. Gently taking a seat on the floor she tugs at her ears in frustration.</p>
						
						<p><span class="colLtCyan">"No, this isn't happening. This is just a really messed up dream."</span></p>
						
						<p><span class="colbeige">"I'm afraid not, Archer." She sighs and shakily stands up again.</span></p>
						
						<p><span class="colLtCyan">"Hey, what a second, I didn't do that. Oh, no. No, no, no, no…."</span> The body stills itself, looking as if it's struggling to decide what to do. 
						
						<p><span class="colbeige">"Look, I'm not evil, ju-"</span>
						
						<p><span class="colLtCyan">"You don't call stealing someone's body evil?!"</span>
						
						<p><span class="colbeige">"Hey, none of this would of happened if you would of held onto the book."</span> Archer continues to struggle against herself for a good five minutes before she slumps back down to the ground. Fully back in control of her own body, she stands back up, a look a complete horror on her face. <span class="colLtCyan">"What... what am I going to do?"</span></p>

						<p><span class="colbeige"><i>For starters, you could grab the book again, and your bracelet.</i></span></p>
						
						<p><span class="colLtCyan">"Wait, why are you just a voice back in my head?"</span></p>
						
						<p><span class="colbeige"><i>Well, it's your body, and it always will be, the only time I can even speak out , let alone move you, are when will power is low. Like if you were really tired and passed out. That kind of thing.</i></span></p>

						<p><span class="colLtCyan">"O-oh... That makes sense, I guess. But why should I grab the bracelet and the book?"</span></p>
						
						<p><span class="colbeige"><i>Well, the bracelet is that gift from the cat-man, no? And the book might have a way to fix this, even if I don't want to...</i></span> She blinks a few times in surprise. Surprised that this spirit, Chandra, is willing to help evict herself. Smiling weakly to herself she replies,</i></p>
						
						<p><span class="colLtCyan">"That sounds like It'll work, hold on."</span> She slips the bracelet back on, but catches something in its reflection. Peering a bit closer, Archer looks to her eyes, now two completely different colors. Her right is still the same <span class="colDkOrange">dull orange</span> as before, but, her left is a <span class="colaquamarine">bright aquamarine</span>. She <i>stares</i>.</p>
						
						<p><span class="colbeige"><i>Hey, wait a minute... that was my eye color!</i></span></p>
						
						<p><span class="colLtCyan">"Are y-you sure?"</span></p>
						
						<p><span class="colbeige"><i>Like I'd forget something like that.</i></span>
						
						<p><span class="colLtCyan">"But-"</span></p>
						
						<p><span class="colbeige"><i>I've been in a book for centuries, there's not much to do besides think of memories...</i></span>
						
						<p><span class="colLtCyan">"Err, right... Sorry."</span>  Starting back towards the book, she doesn't notice an odd, <span class="colbeige">white</span> pattern of fur wrap itself around her upper right arm. The symmetrical pattern looks to be made simply of patterns of squares and lines, yet it looks familiar from the book. For the moment, both Archer and Chandra are clueless to its existence. She grabs the book back off the shelf and tucks it back in her pack.</p>
