You're standing on a simple forest path. The leaves have been raked away, and the resultant walkway has been lined with logs, small trees almost, in order to define the trail more effectively.`n
As you walk the path, the sounds of the Jungle permeate the air: perhaps you hear the quiet sigh of a Gothic Heroine, the roar of a Lion, the low, purring rumble of a passing Kittybike.  If you really listened, you might pick up the occasional muffled `ithump`i of a Panthzer scoring a hit on its prey.
