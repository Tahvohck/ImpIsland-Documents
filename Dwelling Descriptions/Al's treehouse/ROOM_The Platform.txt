The lift creaks as it arrives at the platform, waiting for you to get off before the aged winch beside it whirrs to life to lower it back down to the jungle floor below. Thinking about it, the lift rose on its own as well... no one appears to be around to operate the controls. In fact, there `iare`i no controls.`n`nThe rest of the platform is just as curious, for a treehouse. The platform is large, at least 20 feet of space between the edge and the trunk, with an odd network of pulleys and cables running along along the bottom of the platform above; following them, they appear to be made for raising and lowering the canvas walls to keep out the elements. There's a fire pit near the center, surrounded by a handful of well-worn couches and chairs, none of which match, as if the owner found what they could over time. Bricks keep the smouldering embers from burning down the platform, as well as providing a convenient place to rest your feet to warm them on cold nights.`n`nWooden walls, thin but sturdy, section off the right edge of the platform for use as bedrooms, judging by the modest size of them. Each room has a curtain instead of a door hanging in its entryway, though something about the curtains implies they're just as impassable and sound-muffling as an actual door would be. Right next to those is a short bar, rows of bottles locked in a display case behind it.`n`nAnd finally... if you want to climb even higher, there's a rope ladder leading to the platform above.
