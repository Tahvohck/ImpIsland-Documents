Hidden Trail

# Description
###
This trail is probably the shortest in the camp, appearing for only a few yards before abruptly splitting in three. A sign at the split provides... less than helpful directions. "C/V, Chassis, Door". Well. You're only ever going to find out if you choose a path, aren't you?

[Been here before]
You stop at the familiar signpost, looking at it's cryptic directions. Well, you came all the way out here for a reason, which will it be?
