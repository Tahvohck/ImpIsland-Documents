The Stream

# Description
###
As you walk along the trail, a burbling stream comes into view. Standing at its edge, you guess it's 5, maybe 10 feet across. Peering into the clear water, you'd say, oh maybe, 4 feet deep? Hard to tell without climbing in. You could, too. The bottom seems to be nothing but sand and small, smooth stones. A bridge stretches across, at one of the thinner parts, and the trail continues on the other side. `n`nLooking back into the water, the glint of scales flashes in the shallower parts, near the shore. Hmm. Looks like the fishing would be good, if you had a rod.
