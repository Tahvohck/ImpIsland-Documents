Caves - Raven's cell

###
# Description
###
This cavern is lit by several large gems embedded in the ceiling though you're not sure how you know... the light doesn't seem to be coming from them directly, at least. It's more of a background glow. A cot sits off to one side, legs melded into the stone. A stalagmite has been cut flat on top near the bed and the edges rounded off. There's a distinct lack of Improbability here as well.
