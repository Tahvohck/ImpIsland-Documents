                        <h2>Tahvohck's Journal</h2>
                        <p>These pages will be a journal of all of my 
important Teatimes, discounting the first. I may add in other notes 
along the way, but that will be it's primary use. If you're reading this
 out of context, I am Tahvohck, a contestant on Improbable Island. I'm 
not going to explain that further, as it'll either mean something to you
 or it won't. If it doesn't, well, treat this as fiction. 
Otherwise...well, you probably know the routine, otherwise.</p>
                        <br>
                        
                        <h1>Teatime: 5th<br>Race: Kittymorph</h1>
                        <p>I should have known better. I really should have.<br>I
 knew Horatio was...not happy with me. He had expressed his displeasure 
with me twice so far, popping me out of existence twice, mid-sentence. 
And yet I continued to avoid him, so that I could avoid having my life 
turned upside-down. Well, he got tired of waiting. I was trailblazing at
 my camp, expanding it's reach, looking for secrets in the Jungle, and 
had just reached the lake to sit down and take a break when everything 
went black. </p>
                        <p>I woke up to body-wide pain and more 
darkness. My first thought was that something had ambushed me and I was 
on the Failboat at night. As my other senses returned and the pain 
ebbed, I realized that couldn't be right. There was no rocking, no sound
 of contestants struggling for favor below decks. In fact, there were no
 sounds at all. There was only silence, darkness. And then an unhuman 
chuckle.</p>
                        
                        <p><span class="colaquamarine">"So nice of you to <i>finally</i> join me, Tahvohck. It's been far too long."</span></p>

                        <p>My blood chilled at that. <span class="colDkGreen">"Horatio."</span> He answered with a renewal of the pain.</p>
                        
                        <p><span class="colaquamarine">"Indeed. Why has it been so long, hmm? Don't you <i>enjoy</i> our little chats, our Teatimes?"</span></p>
                        
                        <p><span class="colDkGreen">"Oh, go fuck yourself,"</span> I hissed, struggling to my feet and drawing my sword, looking around, trying to find him. <span class="colDkGreen">"Let's get this over with."</span></p>
                        
                        <p>The chuckle again. <span class="colaquamarine">"I think not, dear boy. Not till you answer my question, at least. Manners, you know."</span></p>
                        
                        <p><span class="colDkGreen">"And what do you know of manners, Horatio? Like you've ever been anything other than a bastard in the end."</span></p>
                        
                        <p>A Joker appeared in front of me, leaning on a cane. <span class="colaquamarine">"I'm hurt. I can be a perfect gentleman if you give me reason to. But it's always <i>fighting</i> with you people. You never come just to chat."</span> I charged him then, only to have him disappear when I swung at him. <span class="colaquamarine">"Oh come now,"</span> he chuckled from behind me, <span class="colaquamarine">"That never works. But enough of that."</span> He vanished as I swung at him again, reappearing beside me, leaning on my shoulder. <span class="colaquamarine">"I think I know why you've been avoiding me."</span> He grinned as I flinched away and stumbled backwards. <span class="colaquamarine">"You're fitting in and don't want to lose that feeling, hmm? Well, then. Let's take that away, shall we?"</span></p>
                        
                        <p>A flash of light. When it faded, I was lying at camp, next to the firepit, Horatio's final laugh fading in my ears. <span class="colaquamarine">"Have fun, dear boy. While you can."</span></p>
